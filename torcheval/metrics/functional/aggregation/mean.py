    Compute weighted mean. When weight is not provided, it calculates the unweighted mean.
    Its class version is ``torcheval.metrics.Mean``.

    weighted_mean = sum(weight * input) / sum(weight)

    Args:
        input (Tensor): Tensor of input values.
        weight(optional): Float or Int or Tensor of input weights. It is default to 1.0. If weight is a Tensor, its size should match the input tensor size.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If value of weight is neither a ``float`` nor a ``int`` nor a ``torch.Tensor`` that matches the input tensor size.

    Examples::

        >>> import torch
        >>> from torcheval.metrics.functional import mean
        >>> mean(torch.tensor([2, 3]))
        tensor(2.5)
